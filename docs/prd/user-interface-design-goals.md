# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The platform should feel like a personal, curated travel journal meets modern discovery app - visually rich yet approachable, with strong emphasis on storytelling and journey visualization. The design should reflect the authentic, walking-pace exploration approach with clean typography, generous use of photography, and intuitive navigation that mirrors the physical experience of neighborhood discovery. The interface should establish credibility and local expertise while remaining accessible to newcomers, creating an immersive experience that differentiates from generic discovery platforms.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Map-Centric Navigation:** Interactive map as primary navigation tool with custom photography-based place markers and dotted walking path journey routes, seamless transitions between map view and detailed content
- **Story-Driven Content:** Instagram-story-style horizontal scroll for journey experiences with clear before/during/after progression and visual storytelling elements
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Essential information immediately visible with deeper details available through intuitive expansion, skeleton screens with neighborhood photography gradually revealing content
- **Weather-Aware Interface:** Dynamic banner showing current conditions with personalized recommendations, subtle visual indicators affecting marker appearance and content suggestions
- **Social Integration Points:** Subtle but clear opportunities for user contribution (suggestions, meetup coordination) without overwhelming the personal curation focus
- **Personal Touch Accessibility:** Prominent but tasteful "call me" feature integration with business relationship indicators that reinforce personal accountability and local connections

## Core Screens and Views

- **Homepage/Landing:** Map overview with featured journeys, recent additions, weather-aware recommendations banner, and exploration mood selector
- **Interactive Map View:** Full-screen map with custom photography markers, journey routes as dotted walking paths, weather overlay, and zoom-dependent information density
- **Place Detail Pages:** Pinterest-inspired rich media presentation with photos, personal review, companion activities, business relationship notes, and "mention my name" indicators
- **Journey Experience Pages:** Step-by-step journey guides with timing, routes, complete experience narratives, and micro-animations for enhanced storytelling
- **Notice Board:** Community events and announcements with visual calendar integration, submission workflows, and categorization features
- **News Commentary Blog:** Personal commentary articles with clean reading experience, social sharing, and distinctive italic styling for curator voice
- **Suggestion Submission:** Progressive disclosure form making it delightful to contribute recommendations with guided workflow
- **About/Contact:** Personal story, local expertise credentials, direct contact options, and business relationship network visualization

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG AA standards ensuring screen reader compatibility, proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, alternative text for all images, and voice command navigation options. This supports the community-focused mission and ensures broad accessibility for all neighborhood explorers while building accessibility considerations from the foundation.

## Branding

**Visual Identity:** Authentic local expertise with warm, approachable aesthetics reminiscent of quality travel journalism and personal storytelling.

**Color Palette Inspired by Indiranagar:**
- **Primary Brand:** Warm terracotta (#B85450) reflecting local architecture and warmth of personal recommendations
- **Secondary:** Deep green (#2D5016) representing tree-lined streets and urban nature integration  
- **Accent:** Bright yellow (#F4D03F) for highlighting weather alerts, featured content, and call-to-action elements
- **Neutrals:** Warm grays (#F8F6F0 for backgrounds, #5D5D5D for secondary text) maintaining readability without sterile feel

**Typography System:**
- **Primary Headers:** Modern serif (Playfair Display style) for personal journal aesthetic with 32-40px desktop, 24-28px mobile sizing
- **Body Text:** Clean sans-serif (Inter/Source Sans Pro style) at 16-18px with 1.6 line height for optimal readability
- **Navigation/UI:** Consistent sans-serif at 14-16px medium weight for clarity
- **Personal Voice Content:** Subtle italic styling for curator commentary to distinguish from factual information

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Optimized for web-first responsive design supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile experiences. Mobile experience is critical given the on-the-go discovery use case, with special attention to:
- Touch-friendly map interactions with custom photography markers
- Fast loading on mobile data with progressive image loading and adaptive performance
- Voice navigation for hands-free exploration during walks/runs
- Offline-friendly content caching for core functionality in areas with poor connectivity
- Location-triggered content and automatic suggestions when GPS detects arrival at recommended areas
