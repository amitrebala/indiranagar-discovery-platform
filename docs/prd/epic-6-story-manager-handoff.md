# Story Manager Handoff: Epic 6 Implementation

## Epic 6: Amit's Personal Curation & Community Platform

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running **Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet mapping**
- Integration points: 
  - Existing `has_amit_visited` database field in places table
  - Current navigation system in `/components/navigation/Header.tsx`
  - Established place detail components in `/components/places/`
  - Existing community suggestions system from Epic 3
  - Homepage CTA structure in `/components/homepage/HeroSection.tsx`
- Existing patterns to follow: 
  - Component-based architecture with TypeScript interfaces
  - Supabase client/server pattern for data access
  - Tailwind CSS design system with accessibility focus
  - Zustand for client state management
  - Progressive enhancement and mobile-first responsive design
- Critical compatibility requirements: 
  - All 186+ existing places must remain accessible
  - Current navigation and routing must be preserved
  - Existing API endpoints cannot be modified (only extended)
  - WCAG AA accessibility compliance must be maintained
  - Performance (Lighthouse 95+ scores) must not degrade
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering **a personalized curation experience that highlights Amit's authentic visited places while adding community engagement features, creating a more intimate and trustworthy neighborhood discovery platform**."

## Implementation Priority

1. **Story 6.1** - Foundation for personal curation (highest business value)
2. **Story 6.2** - Enhanced user experience and search capability  
3. **Story 6.3** - Community platform completion

## Technical Context for Story Development

**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage:**
- Place data with `has_amit_visited: boolean` field already seeded
- Community suggestions workflow established (`/api/community-suggestions/`)
- Navigation store pattern (`/stores/navigationStore.ts`)
- Responsive design patterns across all components
- Comprehensive test suite structure in place

**New Infrastructure Needed:**
- Community comments/ratings database tables
- Personal notes/ratings storage solution
- Enhanced filtering utilities for place curation
- Community hub page structure and routing

**Success Metrics for Each Story:**
- User engagement with personal curation features
- Community interaction rates (comments, ratings)
- Discovery efficiency improvements
- Maintenance of existing performance benchmarks
