## Complete Hands-Off Development Instructions

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

This guide enables completely autonomous development of the V2 Admin Dashboard features. Follow this guide step-by-step to implement all Phase 1 features without needing additional clarification.

**Total Stories:** 7  
**Estimated Time:** 30-40 hours  
**Outcome:** Fully functional admin dashboard with all management features

---

## üéØ PREREQUISITES

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Verify Node.js version
   node --version  # Should be 18+
   
   # Install dependencies if not already done
   cd apps/web
   npm install
   
   # Verify Supabase connection
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000 - should see existing site
   ```

2. **Required Environment Variables:**
   Add to `/apps/web/.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Admin Authentication (REQUIRED - Generate these!)
   ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2a$12$[YourHashHere]
   JWT_SECRET=[32-character-random-string]
   
   # Existing variables should already be present
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[existing]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[existing]
   # Add your Supabase service role key here
   ```

3. **Generate Password Hash:**
   ```javascript
   // Run this in Node console to generate hash
   const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
   const password = 'your-chosen-admin-password';
   const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 12);
   console.log('ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=' + hash);
   ```

4. **Database Migrations:**
   ```sql
   -- Run these in Supabase SQL editor
   -- File: /docs/architecture/v2-shards/4-database-schema-extensions.md
   -- Copy and execute the CREATE TABLE statements
   ```

## üìù HANDOFF NOTES FOR QA

When development is complete:

### What Was Built:
- Complete admin authentication system
- Full admin dashboard with stats
- Place management CRUD operations
- Enhanced question management
- Visual journey builder
- Settings configuration
- Analytics dashboard

### Test Scenarios to Focus On:
1. Authentication flow and session management
2. CRUD operations on all entities
3. Data validation and error handling
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Performance with large datasets

### Known Limitations:
- Analytics uses some mock data (will connect to real analytics later)
- Image upload uses Supabase storage (ensure bucket exists)
- Some features pending Phase 2 (comments, ratings)

---

## üí° DEVELOPER NOTES

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- JWT for stateless auth (24-hour sessions)
- Zustand for client state management
- Server components where possible for performance
- Parallel data fetching for dashboard stats
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### Code Quality Standards:
- All components must be TypeScript
- Follow existing Tailwind patterns
- Use existing UI components from `/components/ui`
- Maintain existing code formatting
- Add comments only for complex logic

---

## üìû EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If completely blocked:

1. **Check Documentation:**
   - `/docs/architecture/v2-shards/` - Technical details
   - `/docs/ux/v2-shards/` - UI specifications
   - `/docs/prd/v2-shards/` - Requirements

2. **Common Patterns:**
   - Authentication: See `/lib/admin/auth.ts`
   - API Routes: See `/app/api/admin/`
   - Components: See `/components/admin/`
   - Stores: See `/stores/`

3. **Fallback Strategy:**
   - Implement with mock data first
   - Get the UI working
   - Connect to real data later
   - Mark TODOs for pending items

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA
