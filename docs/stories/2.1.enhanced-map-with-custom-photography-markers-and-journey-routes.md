# Story 2.1: Enhanced Map with Custom Photography Markers and Journey Routes

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented with all acceptance criteria met

## Story
**As a** visual explorer,  
**I want** an interactive map with distinctive photography-based place markers and visible journey connections,  
**so that** I can see Amit's personal touch and understand how places connect as complete experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Custom map markers using thumbnail photography from each place instead of generic pins
2. Journey route visualization with dotted walking paths connecting related places (e.g., Airlines Hotel → Koshy's route)
3. Different marker styles indicating place categories (restaurants, cafes, activities) with visual hierarchy
4. Hover/touch interactions revealing quick preview information without full popup
5. Smooth zoom-dependent clustering with photography thumbnails maintained at appropriate zoom levels
6. Journey route highlighting when hovering over connected places showing complete experience flow
7. Mobile-optimized marker sizing and touch targets for easy selection on smaller screens

- **Story 1.3**: Established basic map foundation that this story enhances significantly
- **Story 1.7**: Created weather integration that can provide context for journey routes

### Component Architecture Enhancement [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Enhanced Components:**
- **PlaceMarker** - `components/map/PlaceMarker.tsx` - Upgrade to custom photography thumbnails (12-16px standard, 20-24px featured)

- **InteractiveMap** - `components/map/InteractiveMap.tsx` - Enhanced with journey overlays and photo markers

### Visual Design Requirements [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Design System Integration:**
```css
/* Enhanced Marker Styling */
.photo-marker {
  border: 2px solid #B85450; /* Primary brand color */
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 36px;
  height: 36px;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(184, 84, 80, 0.3);
}

.featured-marker {
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  border: 3px solid #F4D03F; /* Accent color for featured places */
}

/* Category Styling */
.category-restaurant { border-color: #B85450; }
.category-cafe { border-color: #2D5016; }
.category-activity { border-color: #F4D03F; }
```

### Journey Route Data Model
```typescript
// Extend existing place schema with journey connections
interface JourneyRoute {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  places: PlaceConnection[];
  estimated_duration: number;
  difficulty_level: 'easy' | 'moderate' | 'challenging';
  weather_dependency: boolean;
}

interface PlaceConnection {
  place_id: string;
  order: number;
  walking_time_minutes: number;
  path_coordinates: LatLng[];
  notes?: string;
}
```

```

### Photography Integration [Source: Story 1.2]
```typescript
interface PhotoMarkerProps {
  place: Place;
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  category: PlaceCategory;
  onMarkerClick: (place: Place) => void;
  onMarkerHover: (place: Place) => void;
}

// Thumbnail optimization for markers
const getThumbnailUrl = (place: Place, size: string) => {
  return place.primary_image 
    ? `${place.primary_image}?w=${size === 'small' ? 36 : size === 'medium' ? 48 : 64}&h=${size === 'small' ? 36 : size === 'medium' ? 48 : 64}&fit=crop&crop=faces`
    : '/images/markers/default-marker.svg';
};
```

### Journey Route Rendering
```typescript
// Leaflet polyline configuration for journey routes
const journeyRouteStyle = {
  color: '#2D5016',
  weight: 3,
  opacity: 0.7,
  dashArray: '10, 10',
  lineCap: 'round',
  lineJoin: 'round'
};

const highlightedRouteStyle = {
  ...journeyRouteStyle,
  color: '#F4D03F',
  weight: 4,
  opacity: 0.9,
  dashArray: '15, 5'
};
```

### Mobile Optimization Considerations [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive markers
- **Performance**: Optimize photo loading and rendering for mobile GPUs
- **Battery**: Efficient rendering to minimize battery drain during exploration
- **Network**: Progressive loading of marker photos based on viewport and zoom

### Preview System Implementation
```typescript
interface MarkerPreview {
  place: Place;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  isVisible: boolean;
}

const PreviewCard = ({ place, position }: MarkerPreview) => (
  <div 
    className="absolute z-50 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-3 pointer-events-none"
    style={{ 
      left: position.x, 
      top: position.y - 120,
      transform: 'translateX(-50%)'
    }}
  >
    <img src={getThumbnailUrl(place, 'medium')} className="w-12 h-12 rounded mb-2" />
    <h4 className="font-medium text-sm">{place.name}</h4>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-600">{place.category}</p>
    <div className="flex items-center text-xs">
      <span className="text-yellow-500">★</span>
      <span className="ml-1">{place.rating}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Photo Loading**: Lazy load marker photos with intersection observer
- **Clustering**: Maintain photo visibility while clustering efficiently
- **Route Rendering**: Optimize polyline rendering for complex journey paths
- **Memory Management**: Efficiently cache and dispose of marker photo resources

### State Management Enhancement [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Enhanced map store for journey and photo features
interface EnhancedMapStore extends MapStore {
  selectedJourney: JourneyRoute | null;
  hoveredPlace: Place | null;
  markerPhotoCache: Map<string, string>;
  
  // Actions
  selectJourney: (journey: JourneyRoute) => void;
  setHoveredPlace: (place: Place | null) => void;
  cacheMarkerPhoto: (placeId: string, photoUrl: string) => void;
}
```

### Integration Dependencies
- **Story 1.2**: Requires place images and database structure
- **Story 1.3**: Extends basic map functionality
- **Story 2.3**: Journey routes will connect to companion activities
- **Story 1.7**: Weather context may influence route visibility

### Technical Constraints
- **Photo Performance**: Must load efficiently on mobile connections
- **Marker Density**: Photo markers require more rendering resources
- **Journey Complexity**: Route visualization must remain clear with multiple overlapping paths
- **Touch Accuracy**: Photo markers must maintain usability on small screens

### Accessibility Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive alt text for all marker photos
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support keyboard navigation between markers
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels for marker interactions and journey routes
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for category indicators
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear focus indicators for keyboard users
