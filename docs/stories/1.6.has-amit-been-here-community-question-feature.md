### Component Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Core Component Implementation:**
- **HasAmitBeenHereButton** - `components/community/HasAmitBeenHereButton.tsx` - Floating community engagement with modal form
- **SuggestionForm** - `components/community/SuggestionForm.tsx` - User suggestions with location auto-fill and response time expectations
- **NoticeBoard** - `components/community/NoticeBoard.tsx` - Events and announcements (for future FAQ display)

### Database Schema Design [Source: Story 1.2 Foundation]
```sql
-- Community Suggestions Table
CREATE TABLE suggestions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  location_context VARCHAR(255),
  contact_name VARCHAR(100),
  contact_email VARCHAR(255),
  contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'new' CHECK (status IN ('new', 'in-progress', 'answered', 'archived')),
  response TEXT,
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  category VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  responded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_suggestions_status ON suggestions(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_suggestions_created_at ON suggestions(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_suggestions_public ON suggestions(is_public) WHERE is_public = true;
```

### Form Validation Schema [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

export const SuggestionSchema = z.object({
  question: z.string()
    .min(10, 'Question must be at least 10 characters')
    .max(1000, 'Question must be less than 1000 characters'),
  location_context: z.string()
    .max(255, 'Location context must be less than 255 characters')
    .optional(),
  contact_name: z.string()
    .min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters')
    .max(100, 'Name must be less than 100 characters'),
  contact_email: z.string()
    .email('Invalid email address')
    .optional(),
  contact_phone: z.string()
    .regex(/^[\+]?[1-9][\d]{0,15}$/, 'Invalid phone number')
    .optional(),
});
```

### Floating Button Design [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
```css
/* Floating Button Positioning */
.floating-community-button {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 24px;
  right: 24px;
  z-index: 1000; /* Below map controls (z-index: 1010) */
  
  /* Mobile adjustments */
  @media (max-width: 767px) {
    bottom: 80px; /* Account for mobile navigation */
    right: 16px;
  }
}

/* Distinctive Styling */
.community-button {
  background: #B85450; /* Primary brand color */
  color: white;
  border-radius: 50px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 600;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(184, 84, 80, 0.3);
}
```

### State Management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Community Store using Zustand
interface CommunityStore {
  isModalOpen: boolean;
  currentQuestion: string;
  locationContext: string;
  
  // Actions
  openModal: (locationContext?: string) => void;
  closeModal: () => void;
  setQuestion: (question: string) => void;
}
```

### API Route Implementation [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// app/api/suggestions/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { SuggestionSchema } from '@/lib/validations';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    const validatedData = SuggestionSchema.parse(body);
    
    // Rate limiting check
    const isRateLimited = await checkRateLimit(request);
    if (isRateLimited) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Too many requests. Please try again later.' },
        { status: 429 }
      );
    }
    
    // Store in database
    const suggestion = await createSuggestion(validatedData);
    
    // Send email notification
    await sendNewQuestionNotification(suggestion);
    
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      message: 'Question submitted successfully',
      id: suggestion.id 
    }, { status: 201 });
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
}
```

### Email Notification System
```typescript
// lib/email/notifications.ts
interface EmailService {
  sendNewQuestionAlert: (suggestion: Suggestion) => Promise<void>;
  sendQuestionAnswered: (suggestion: Suggestion) => Promise<void>;
}

// Email Template for New Questions
const newQuestionTemplate = {
  subject: `New question: "${question.substring(0, 50)}..."`,
  html: `
    <h2>New Community Question</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> ${question}</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${location || 'Not specified'}</p>
    <p><strong>From:</strong> ${contactName} (${contactEmail})</p>
    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> ${contactPhone || 'Not provided'}</p>
    <p><strong>Submitted:</strong> ${new Date().toLocaleString()}</p>
    <a href="${adminUrl}/suggestions/${id}">View in Admin Dashboard</a>
  `
};
```

### Strengths
- Complete core functionality implementation exceeding Epic 1 requirements
- Professional-grade UI/UX with excellent mobile optimization
- Comprehensive form validation and security measures
- Outstanding database design with proper RLS policies
- Seamless integration with existing system components
- Clean, maintainable code architecture

### Future Enhancement Opportunities (Epic 3)

- Advanced moderation and response management tools
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> ${question}</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${location_context || 'Not specified'}</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> ${contact_name} (${contact_email})</p>
    <p><strong>Submitted:</strong> ${new Date().toLocaleString()}</p>
  `
};
```

### Mobile Optimization Considerations
- **Button Size**: Minimum 44px touch target for accessibility
- **Positioning**: Avoid interference with mobile navigation and map controls
- **Modal**: Full-screen on mobile for better UX
- **Form**: Optimized input fields for mobile keyboards
- **Performance**: Lazy load modal content until needed

### Accessibility Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Focus Management**: Trap focus within modal when open
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support Escape to close, Tab navigation
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and live regions
- **Color Contrast**: Button and text meet WCAG AA standards
- **Skip Links**: Allow skipping floating button if desired

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
// Prevent spam submissions
const RATE_LIMITS = {
  questions_per_hour: 3,
  questions_per_day: 10,
  same_question_cooldown: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
};
```

### Admin Interface Requirements
- **Authentication**: Secure admin access with Supabase Auth
- **Question Management**: List, filter, search, and respond to questions
- **Status Tracking**: Update question status and response
- **Public Control**: Choose which questions to make public
- **Analytics**: Basic metrics on question volume and response times

### Integration Points
- **Global Layout**: Button appears on all pages via root layout
- **Map Integration**: Proper z-index to avoid map control conflicts
- **Place Pages**: Contextual questions with place information pre-filled
- **Admin Dashboard**: Link from main navigation for Amit's access
- **FAQ Page**: Link from footer and question submission confirmation

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Modal component only loads when needed
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation before API submission
- **Caching**: Cache FAQ content for public display
- **Email Delivery**: Async email sending to avoid blocking form submission

### Security Considerations
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent XSS attacks in question text
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
- **Email Validation**: Verify email addresses before sending notifications
- **Admin Access**: Secure authentication for question management
- **Data Privacy**: Handle contact information securely

### Technical Constraints
- **Email Service**: Must integrate with service within free tiers (SendGrid, etc.)
- **Storage**: Question data must fit within Supabase free tier limits
- **Performance**: Modal and form must be responsive and fast
- **Mobile UX**: Must work seamlessly on mobile devices
