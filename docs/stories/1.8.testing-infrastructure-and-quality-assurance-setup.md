## Testing

### Testing Framework [Source: architecture/testing-infrastructure.md]
This story creates the testing framework itself, so testing focuses on:
- **Configuration Validation**: Test that all test configurations work correctly
- **Mock Service Validation**: Test that MSW mocks provide consistent responses
- **CI/CD Pipeline Testing**: Validate the GitHub Actions workflow
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test that coverage thresholds are enforced

### Test File Locations
Since this story creates the testing infrastructure:
- **Setup Validation**: `apps/web/tests/setup.test.ts`
- **Mock Validation**: `apps/web/tests/mocks/validation.test.ts`
- **CI/CD Testing**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` (workflow validation)
- **Coverage Testing**: Validate coverage reporting accuracy

### Key Test Scenarios
- **Framework Setup**: Test Vitest configuration loads correctly
- **Mock Services**: Test MSW handlers provide expected responses
- **E2E Configuration**: Test Playwright setup across browsers
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test coverage thresholds are enforced
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Test automated testing workflow
- **Environment Setup**: Test test environment initialization

### Testing Standards
This story establishes the testing standards that all other stories will follow:
- Use semantic queries for accessibility-focused testing
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include visual regression testing where applicable
- Maintain minimum coverage thresholds
