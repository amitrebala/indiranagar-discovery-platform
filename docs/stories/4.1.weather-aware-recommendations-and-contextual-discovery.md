### Weather Recommendation Engine
```typescript
const WeatherRecommendationEngine = {
  generateRecommendations: (weatherData: WeatherData, userLocation: Coordinates) => {
    const places = getPlacesNearLocation(userLocation);
    
    return places
      .map(place => ({
        place,
        suitability_score: calculateWeatherSuitability(place, weatherData),
        weather_reasoning: generateWeatherReasoning(place, weatherData),
        alternative_suggestions: getAlternatives(place, weatherData)
      }))
      .filter(rec => rec.suitability_score > 0.6)
      .sort((a, b) => b.suitability_score - a.suitability_score);
  },

  adaptToWeatherChange: async (currentJourney: Journey, newWeather: WeatherData) => {
    const adaptations = await analyzeJourneyWeatherImpact(currentJourney, newWeather);
    
    if (adaptations.severity === 'high') {
      return {
        recommend_postpone: true,
        alternative_indoor_journey: await generateIndoorAlternative(currentJourney),
        safe_shelter_locations: await findNearbyShelter(currentJourney.current_location)
