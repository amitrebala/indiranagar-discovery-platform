### Supabase Configuration [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Row Level Security for secure multi-tenant operations
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth with social login support
- **Storage**: Optimized image delivery for place photography
- **Real-time**: Subscriptions for live community features
- **Integration**: Server and client-side configurations required

### Environment Variables Setup [Source: architecture/external-apis-integration.md]
Required environment variables:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Design System Setup [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
Tailwind configuration must include custom color palette:
```css
colors: {
  primary: '#B85450',     // Warm terracotta
  secondary: '#2D5016',   // Deep green  
  accent: '#F4D03F',      // Bright yellow
  success: '#27AE60',     // Positive feedback
  warning: '#F39C12',     // Weather cautions
  error: '#E74C3C',       // Errors
  neutral: {
    50: '#F8F6F0',        // Light background
    600: '#5D5D5D'        // Secondary text
  }
}
```

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for pages/utilities, PascalCase for components
- **TypeScript**: Explicit type definitions, strict compiler settings
- **Components**: One component per file, named exports preferred
- **API Routes**: Follow REST conventions with proper error handling
- **Git Commits**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

### File Locations for New Code
Based on project structure, create these exact paths:
- **Supabase Client**: `apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `apps/web/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- **Environment Config**: `apps/web/.env.local.example`
- **Tailwind Config**: `apps/web/tailwind.config.js`
- **TypeScript Config**: `apps/web/tsconfig.json`
- **Next.js Config**: `apps/web/next.config.js`
- **Package Config**: `apps/web/package.json`

### Technical Constraints
- **Vercel Free Tier**: Must stay within serverless function limits
- **Supabase Free Tier**: 500MB database, 1GB file storage, 50MB file uploads
- **Performance**: Target Core Web Vitals compliance
- **Security**: Implement proper environment variable handling, no secrets in code

## Testing

### Testing Framework [Source: architecture/testing-infrastructure.md]
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest with Testing Library for component testing
- **E2E**: Playwright for critical user journeys
- **Mocking**: MSW for API mocking consistency
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement

### Test File Locations
- **Component Tests**: `apps/web/tests/components/`
- **API Tests**: `apps/web/tests/api/`
- **E2E Tests**: `apps/web/tests/e2e/`
- **Mocks**: `apps/web/tests/__mocks__/`

### Testing Configuration Files
- **Vitest Config**: `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
- **Playwright Config**: `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Setup**: `apps/web/tests/setup.ts`

### Testing Standards
- Use Testing Library best practices with semantic queries
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, APIs) using MSW
- Include accessibility testing with Testing Library utilities
- Test error states and loading states for all components
