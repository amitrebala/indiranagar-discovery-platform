### Design System Integration [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px-767px (on-location discovery) - Primary focus
- Tablet: 768px-1023px (casual browsing)
- Desktop: 1024px-1439px (detailed planning)
- Wide: 1440px+ (admin workflows)

**Color Palette for Map Elements:**
```css
colors: {
  primary: '#B85450',     // Marker highlighting
  secondary: '#2D5016',   // Map UI elements
  accent: '#F4D03F',      // Selected states
  neutral: {
    50: '#F8F6F0',        // Map backgrounds
    600: '#5D5D5D'        // Secondary text
  }
}
```

### Map Configuration Requirements
```typescript
// Map Center and Bounds for Indiranagar
const INDIRANAGAR_CENTER = {
  lat: 12.9716,
  lng: 77.5946
};

const INDIRANAGAR_BOUNDS = {
  north: 13.0000,
  south: 12.9500,
  east: 77.6500,
  west: 77.5800
};

// Zoom Levels
const DEFAULT_ZOOM = 15;
const MIN_ZOOM = 13;
const MAX_ZOOM = 18;
```

### Performance Optimization [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without JavaScript, enhanced with interactivity
- **Edge-First Caching**: Strategic caching for map tiles and place data
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image optimization for marker thumbnails
- **Marker Clustering**: Essential for performance with 100+ place markers

### Place Data Integration [Source: Story 1.2]
```typescript
interface PlaceMarkerProps {
  place: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    rating: number;
    primary_image?: string;
  };
  onMarkerClick: (place: Place) => void;
}
```

### Mobile-First Considerations [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
- **Touch Optimization**: Optimize touch controls for mobile discovery
- **Gesture Handling**: Pan, zoom, and marker selection for mobile
- **Loading Performance**: Optimize for mobile network conditions
- **Accessibility**: Ensure map is accessible with keyboard navigation and screen readers

### State Management Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Map Store using Zustand
interface MapStore {
  center: LatLng;
  zoom: number;
  selectedPlace: Place | null;
  mapBounds: LatLngBounds | null;
  
  // Actions
  setMapView: (center: LatLng, zoom: number) => void;
  selectPlace: (place: Place) => void;
  clearSelection: () => void;
}
```

### Error Handling Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Network Errors**: Handle tile loading failures with fallback
- **Data Errors**: Graceful handling of missing place data
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fallback for browsers without proper map support
- **Performance**: Error boundaries to prevent map crashes affecting entire app

### Integration Dependencies
- **Story 1.1**: Requires Next.js foundation and project structure
- **Story 1.2**: Requires place database and data fetching capabilities
- **Story 1.4**: Will integrate with homepage navigation
- **Story 1.5**: Will link to individual place detail pages

### Technical Constraints
- **Mobile Performance**: Map must load quickly on mobile devices
- **Marker Density**: 100+ markers require clustering for performance
- **Touch Interface**: Must work well on touch devices for on-location discovery
- **Network Resilience**: Must handle poor network conditions gracefully

### Future Integration Points
- **Weather Overlay**: Story 1.7 will add weather context to map
- **Journey Routes**: Future stories will add journey path visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Future community features may add real-time marker updates
