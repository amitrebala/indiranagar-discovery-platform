## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the foundational Next.js project with Supabase integration. This story builds on that foundation to create the core data layer for the discovery platform.

### Database Schema Requirements [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL 15+ with Row Level Security for secure multi-tenant operations
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for optimized image delivery with CDN
- **Real-time**: Real-time subscriptions capability for live community features
- **Authentication**: Built-in Supabase Auth for content management security

### Data Models and Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Required data models for shared types:
```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/place.ts
interface Place {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  rating: number;
  metadata: PlaceMetadata;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface PlaceMetadata {
  category: string;
  weather_suitability: WeatherCondition[];
  companion_activities: CompanionActivity[];
  accessibility_info?: string;
  best_time_to_visit?: string;
}
```

### Supabase Configuration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with relational capabilities for complex place relationships
- **Storage**: Built-in CDN optimization for photography storage
- **Cache**: Built-in Edge Cache for database-level caching
- **Authentication**: Row Level Security for secure content management

### File Locations for New Code
Based on project structure:
- **Database Types**: `apps/web/lib/supabase/types.ts`
- **Database Client**: `apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts` (extends from Story 1.1)
- **Shared Types**: `packages/shared/src/types/place.ts`
- **Database Migrations**: Create `supabase/migrations/` directory
- **Seeding Scripts**: `scripts/seed-database.ts`
- **Validation Schemas**: `apps/web/lib/validations.ts` (extends from Story 1.1)

### Storage Configuration Requirements
```typescript
// Supabase Storage Buckets
- place-images: Public bucket for place photography
- place-documents: Private bucket for internal content
- thumbnails: Auto-generated thumbnails for performance
```

### Content Validation Rules [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Coordinate Validation**: Ensure coordinates fall within Indiranagar boundaries (lat: 12.95-13.00, lng: 77.58-77.65)
- **Rating Validation**: 1-5 scale with 0.1 decimal precision
- **Required Fields**: name, description, coordinates, rating must be present
- **Image Validation**: File size limits, format restrictions (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

  place_id UUID REFERENCES places(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  activity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'before' | 'after'
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  timing_minutes INTEGER,
  weather_dependent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,

```

### Content Management Security [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Row Level Security**: Enable RLS on all tables
- **Authentication**: Require authentication for content creation/modification
- **Validation**: Server-side validation for all content updates
- **Audit Trail**: Track all content changes with timestamps and user attribution

### Performance Considerations [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Indexing**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields (coordinates, category, rating)
- **Caching**: Utilize Supabase Edge Cache for place data
- **Image Optimization**: Auto-generate thumbnails and optimized formats
- **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large place datasets

### Technical Constraints
- **Supabase Free Tier**: 500MB database limit, must be efficient with schema design
- **File Storage**: 1GB storage limit, optimize image sizes and formats
- **Security**: All content operations must respect Row Level Security policies
- **Performance**: Database queries must be optimized for mobile discovery use cases

### Integration Points
- **Story 1.1 Dependencies**: Requires Supabase client configuration from previous story
- **Story 1.3 Requirements**: Provides data layer for interactive map markers
- **Story 1.5 Dependencies**: Enables individual place detail page content
- **Future Weather Integration**: Schema supports weather_suitability for Story 1.7

## Testing

### Testing Framework [Source: architecture/testing-infrastructure.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for database operations, validation functions, seeding scripts
- **Integration Tests**: Test Supabase operations with test database

- **Storage Tests**: `apps/web/tests/lib/storage.test.ts`
- **Seeding Tests**: `apps/web/tests/scripts/seed-database.test.ts`

### Testing Requirements

- **Storage Operations**: Test image upload, retrieval, and optimization
- **Content Validation**: Test all validation rules and error cases
- **Seeding Process**: Test database population with various data formats
- **Performance**: Test query performance with large datasets

### Testing Standards
