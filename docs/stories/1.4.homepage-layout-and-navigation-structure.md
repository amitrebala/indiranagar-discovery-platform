### SEO Configuration Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Homepage Metadata
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Indiranagar Discovery | Personal Place Recommendations',
  description: 'Discover hidden gems in Indiranagar with personal recommendations from a local expert. Weather-aware exploration with 100+ curated places.',
  keywords: 'Indiranagar, Bangalore, places, recommendations, local expert, weather-aware',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Indiranagar Discovery Platform',
    description: 'Personal place recommendations from local expert',
    images: ['/images/og-image.jpg'],
    locale: 'en_US',
    type: 'website',
  },
  twitter: {
    card: 'summary_large_image',
    title: 'Indiranagar Discovery Platform',
    description: 'Personal place recommendations from local expert',
    images: ['/images/twitter-image.jpg'],
  }
};
```

### Navigation Structure
```typescript
// Main Navigation Items
const navigationItems = [
  { href: '/', label: 'Home', icon: 'home' },
  { href: '/map', label: 'Map', icon: 'map' },
  { href: '/places', label: 'Places', icon: 'places' },
  { href: '/about', label: 'About', icon: 'user' }
];
```

### Performance Optimization [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Image Optimization:**
```typescript
// Next.js Image Configuration
<Image
  src={place.image_url}
  alt={place.name}
  fill
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
  className="object-cover"
  priority={false} // Only true for above-fold images
/>
```

**Loading Performance:**
- Critical CSS inlined for above-fold content
- Lazy loading for featured places images
- Preload critical fonts (Playfair Display, Inter)
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

### State Management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Navigation Store using Zustand
interface NavigationStore {
  isMobileMenuOpen: boolean;
  activeSection: string;
  
  // Actions
  toggleMobileMenu: () => void;
  setActiveSection: (section: string) => void;
}
```

### Accessibility Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- **Navigation**: ARIA labels for navigation items
- **Images**: Alt text for all images, including decorative
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators and keyboard navigation
- **Screen Readers**: Proper landmarks and skip links
- **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG AA standards for all text

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

- **Story 1.3**: Navigation links to map page
- **Story 1.5**: Featured places link to individual place detail pages
- **Story 1.6**: May integrate "Has Amit Been Here?" floating button

### Content Strategy
**Hero Section Value Proposition:**
- Local expert with 100+ place discoveries
- Personal curation vs. generic recommendations
- Weather-aware discovery guidance
- Authentic neighborhood exploration
