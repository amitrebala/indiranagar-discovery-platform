## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1: Established Next.js foundation with dynamic routing capabilities
- Story 1.2: Created place database schema that provides comprehensive place data
- Story 1.3: Created interactive map that detail pages will integrate with
- Story 1.4: Created navigation structure that includes places section

### Component Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Core Components Implementation:**
- **PlaceDetail** - `components/places/PlaceDetail.tsx` - Rich place content
- **CompanionActivityCard** - `components/places/CompanionActivityCard.tsx` - Before/after activities with timing and weather suitability  
- **MemoryPalaceStory** - `components/places/MemoryPalaceStory.tsx` - Personal narratives with photo galleries

### Dynamic Routing Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
```
apps/web/app/places/
├── page.tsx              # Place database listing
└── [slug]/
    └── page.tsx          # Individual place detail pages
```

### Data Model Integration [Source: Story 1.2]
```typescript
interface PlaceDetailData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  rating: number;
  category: string;
  weather_suitability: string[];
  accessibility_info?: string;
  best_time_to_visit?: string;
  images: PlaceImage[];
  companion_activities: CompanionActivity[];
  contact_info?: ContactInfo;
}

interface CompanionActivity {
  id: string;
  activity_type: 'before' | 'after';
  name: string;
  description: string;
  timing_minutes: number;
  weather_dependent: boolean;
}
```

### Design System Integration [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture-integration.md]
**Typography System:**
```css
/* Reading Experience Optimization */
.place-title { font-family: 'Playfair Display'; font-size: 2.5rem; }
.place-description { font-family: 'Inter'; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.75; }
.activity-text { font-family: 'Inter'; font-size: 1rem; }
```

**Color Palette Usage:**
- Primary (#B85450): Rating stars, CTA buttons
- Secondary (#2D5016): Section headers, navigation elements
- Accent (#F4D03F): Interactive elements, sharing buttons
- Neutral: Content backgrounds and text

### SEO and Metadata Configuration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Dynamic Metadata Generation
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: PlacePageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const place = await getPlaceBySlug(params.slug);
  
  return {
    title: `${place.name} | Indiranagar Discovery`,
    description: place.description.substring(0, 160),
    openGraph: {
      title: place.name,
      description: `Personal recommendation: ${place.description}`,
      images: [place.primary_image_url],
      type: 'article',
    },
    twitter: {
      card: 'summary_large_image',
      title: place.name,
      description: place.description.substring(0, 200),
      images: [place.primary_image_url],
    }
  };
}
```

### Image Optimization [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Gallery Image Configuration
<Image
  src={image.url}
  alt={image.caption || place.name}
  width={800}
  height={600}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 70vw"
  className="object-cover rounded-lg"
  priority={index === 0} // Only first image has priority
/>
```

### Social Sharing Integration
```typescript
// Native Share API with Fallback
const sharePlace = async (place: Place) => {
  const shareData = {
    title: place.name,
    text: `Check out this place in Indiranagar: ${place.name}`,
    url: `${window.location.origin}/places/${place.slug}`
  };
  
  if (navigator.share) {
    await navigator.share(shareData);
  } else {
    // Fallback to social sharing buttons
    showSharingModal(shareData);
  }
};
```

### Mobile Reading Experience Optimization
- **Typography**: Larger font sizes on mobile (18px minimum for body text)
- **Spacing**: Generous white space for comfortable reading
- **Images**: Full-width images with proper aspect ratios
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements minimum 44px
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for below-fold content

### State Management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
```typescript
// Place Detail Store
interface PlaceDetailStore {
  currentPlace: Place | null;
  setCurrentPlace: (place: Place | null) => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
  setIsLoading: (loading: boolean) => void;
}
```
