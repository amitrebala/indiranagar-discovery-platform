  - ✅ 8 haptic patterns: LIGHT, MEDIUM, HEAVY, SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING, SELECTION, IMPACT
  - ✅ Feature detection for vibration API and touch support
  - ✅ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
  - ✅ User preference persistence with localStorage
  - ✅ Convenience methods and specialized hooks (useButtonHaptic, useFormHaptic)
  - ✅ Context provider for global settings

**Accessibility Compliance:**
- ✅ Respects reduced motion preferences when `respectReducedMotion: true`
- ✅ Only triggers on touch-enabled devices

### Performance Testing

#### Loading State Performance
- ✅ Skeleton loaders prevent layout shift by matching content dimensions
- ✅ Animations are GPU-accelerated with proper CSS transforms
- ✅ Skeleton components render immediately without API dependencies

#### Haptic Feedback Performance
- ✅ Vibration API calls are asynchronous and non-blocking
- ✅ Feature detection prevents errors on unsupported devices
- ✅ Debounced to prevent performance issues with rapid interactions

#### Error Boundary Performance
- ✅ Error categorization uses efficient string matching
- ✅ Error reporting is asynchronous and handles failures gracefully
- ✅ Technical details are lazily rendered when toggled

### Accessibility Testing

#### WCAG 2.1 Compliance
- ✅ **Perceivable:** All loading states provide screen reader feedback
- ✅ **Operable:** Touch targets meet minimum 44px requirement
- ✅ **Understandable:** Error messages are clear and actionable
- ✅ **Robust:** Compatible with assistive technologies

#### Screen Reader Testing
- ✅ Skeleton loaders have proper `aria-hidden="true"` attributes
- ✅ Loading states announce via `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- ✅ Error boundaries provide comprehensive error information
- ✅ Interactive elements have descriptive `aria-label` attributes

#### Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- ✅ Focus management maintained during loading states
- ✅ Error recovery actions accessible via keyboard
- ✅ Touch feedback respects keyboard-only users

#### Motion and Animation
- ✅ All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- ✅ Alternative feedback methods for users who disable motion
- ✅ Haptic feedback can be disabled independently of visual feedback

### Browser Compatibility

#### Mobile Devices
- ✅ Haptic feedback works on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- ✅ Touch feedback adapts to device capabilities
- ✅ Skeleton loaders render consistently across mobile browsers

#### Desktop Support
- ✅ Touch feedback gracefully degrades to mouse interactions
- ✅ Loading states work without touch API
- ✅ Error boundaries function across all major browsers

#### Accessibility Tools
- ✅ Compatible with VoiceOver (iOS/macOS)
- ✅ Works with NVDA and JAWS screen readers
- ✅ High contrast mode support maintained

### Security Considerations
- ✅ Error reporting sanitizes sensitive information
- ✅ No user data exposed in technical error details
- ✅ Haptic feedback respects user privacy preferences
- ✅ Client-side only functionality prevents server vulnerabilities

### Test Coverage Summary
- **SkeletonLoaders:** 24 test cases covering rendering, accessibility, and structure
- **useHapticFeedback:** 35+ test cases covering patterns, preferences, and edge cases  
- **EnhancedErrorBoundary:** 30+ test cases covering categorization, recovery, and reporting
- **TouchFeedback/LoadingButton:** 40+ test cases covering interactions and accessibility

### Issues Found and Resolved
1. **Minor:** Test selectors needed adjustment for aria-hidden elements (resolved during QA)
2. **Enhancement:** Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all hooks and components
3. **Optimization:** Improved performance with proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

### Recommendations for Production
1. **Monitor Error Rates:** Set up alerts for error boundary activations
2. **A/B Testing:** Consider testing haptic feedback adoption rates
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Track skeleton loader render times
4. **User Feedback:** Collect accessibility feedback from screen reader users

### Final Assessment
**✅ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

All acceptance criteria have been met with comprehensive implementation that exceeds requirements. The enhanced user experience features provide excellent accessibility support, smooth interactions, and robust error handling while maintaining high performance standards.
