# Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this is a **greenfield project** with a clear technology preference for Next.js + Supabase + Vercel stack. The project will leverage:

- **Next.js 14+ App Router** for optimal SSR/SSG hybrid approach
- **Supabase** for backend-as-a-service with PostgreSQL, authentication, and real-time features
- **Vercel** for seamless deployment with global CDN optimization

**Rationale:** This stack choice aligns with the PRD requirements for zero-cost hosting, rapid development timeline (6-8 weeks), and scalability needs while supporting the weather-aware, photography-rich discovery platform with real-time community features.
