# 1. INTRODUCTION

This architecture document defines the technical implementation approach for NEW features being added to the Indiranagar Discovery Platform. It builds upon the existing Jamstack architecture (Next.js 15 + Supabase) and focuses only on additions, not modifications to existing systems.

## 1.1 Scope
This document covers architectural decisions for:
- Admin Dashboard System (password-protected)
- Comment & Rating Systems (anonymous-capable)
- Journey Builder & Management
- Enhanced Analytics Pipeline
- Call & Directions Integration
- Companion Activities Engine
- Advanced Weather Features

## 1.2 Architecture Principles
- **Incremental Enhancement** - Add features without breaking existing functionality
- **Database Extension** - New tables, don't modify existing schema
- **API Addition** - New routes alongside existing ones
- **Component Isolation** - New features in separate components
- **Performance First** - Caching and optimization from day one
