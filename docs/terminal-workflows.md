## Collaboration Protocols

### Dev+QA Integrated Workflow

Each terminal follows integrated development with embedded QA:

1. **Planning**: Dev + QA plan stories together
2. **Development**: QA writes tests during development  
3. **Testing**: Continuous testing throughout development
4. **Integration**: Joint integration testing with other terminals
5. **Deployment**: Coordinated deployment with validation

### Coordination Updates

Each terminal updates collaboration documents:

- **API Contracts**: Updated before any interface changes
- **Component Registry**: Shared components documented and versioned
- **Integration Points**: Cross-terminal dependencies tracked
- **Progress Status**: Real-time status updates for orchestrator

### Communication Channels

- **Terminal Sync**: Daily 15-minute sync between terminal leads
- **Integration Meetings**: Bi-weekly cross-terminal coordination
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediate escalation to orchestrator terminal
- **Strategic Planning**: Weekly orchestrator review and planning session
