## Critical Path & Dependencies
1. **Complete Story 1.4** ‚Üí Unlocks Epic 2 development
2. **Implement Story 1.7** (Weather API) ‚Üí Required by 8+ future stories
3. **Setup Story 1.8** (Testing) ‚Üí Quality gate for all future development

## Technical Quality Assessment
- **Completed Stories**: Consistently high quality (A+ grades)
- **Architecture**: Solid foundation with modern stack  
- **Code Quality**: Excellent with comprehensive implementations
- **Technical Debt**: Low in completed areas, manageable

## Current Blockers
- Testing infrastructure incomplete (hook call errors in tests)
- Weather API integration missing (blocks multiple advanced features)
- Homepage layout needs completion before Epic 2 development

## Estimated Completion Timeline
