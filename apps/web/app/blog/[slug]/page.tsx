  slug: 'evolution-100-feet-road-decade-change',
  content: `
    <p>Walking down 100 Feet Road today, it's hard to imagine this was once a quiet residential street with more trees than traffic lights. Over the past decade, I've watched this main artery of Indiranagar transform from a neighborhood connector into one of Bangalore's most happening commercial strips.</p>

    <h2>The Catalyst: Metro Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The single biggest game-changer was the Indiranagar Metro Station. When it opened in 2011, it didn't just connect us to the rest of the city - it fundamentally shifted how people discovered and experienced our neighborhood. Suddenly, weekend visitors weren't limited to those with cars or the patience for endless traffic jams.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"The metro didn't just bring people to Indiranagar, it brought a new kind of energy. The foot traffic, the weekend explorers, the young professionals who could suddenly live here and commute easily - it all changed the commercial equation."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>From Residential to Commercial</h2>
    <p>I remember when getting a good cup of coffee meant a trip to Forum Mall or a compromise with instant coffee at home. Now, within a 500-meter radius of any point on 100 Feet Road, you'll find at least three specialty coffee shops, each with its own personality and loyal following.</p>

    <p>The transformation wasn't overnight, but it was systematic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2011-2013:</strong> The first wave brought chain restaurants and established brands</li>
      <li><strong>2014-2016:</strong> Independent cafes and boutique stores started appearing</li>
      <li><strong>2017-2019:</strong> The craft beer revolution and experiential dining</li>
      <li><strong>2020-2024:</strong> Post-pandemic resilience and community-focused businesses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Human Cost of Progress</h2>
    <p>But transformation always comes with trade-offs. The small grocery store where aunty knew everyone's usual order? Replaced by a trendy organic market. The repair shop that could fix anything for ‚Çπ50? Gone, because the rent went up 400%.</p>

    <p>These aren't just business changes - they're community changes. When you lose the spaces where neighbors naturally interact, you lose something harder to quantify but equally important: the social fabric that makes a neighborhood feel like home.</p>

    <h2>Finding Balance</h2>
    <p>The best businesses that have emerged understand this balance. They're not just capitalizing on foot traffic; they're contributing to the community. The new bookstore-cafe that hosts poetry readings. The restaurant that sources from local vendors and employs neighborhood youth. The fitness studio that organizes community runs.</p>

    <p>These places get it: commercial success and community building aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, in a neighborhood like Indiranagar, they're symbiotic.</p>

    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
    <p>As I write this in 2024, I see the next wave starting. Sustainability is becoming more than a buzzword. Digital-first businesses are creating physical community spaces. The pandemic taught us that neighborhoods matter more than we realized.</p>

    <p>The challenge for the next decade will be managing growth while preserving character. How do we welcome new businesses and residents while maintaining the community connections that make Indiranagar special?</p>

    <p>I don't have all the answers, but I'm optimistic. The same community spirit that made this transformation possible is still here. It's evolved, adapted, but it's still the beating heart of what makes this more than just another commercial district.</p>

    <p>It's still home.</p>
