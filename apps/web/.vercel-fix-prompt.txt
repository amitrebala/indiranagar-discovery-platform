**ERROR LOG FILES PROVIDED:**
1. Error Report: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/.vercel-error-report.txt (parsed errors and summary)
2. Full Build Log: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/.vercel-build-full.log (complete build output)
3. Error Log: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/.vercel-errors.log (categorized errors)
4. Recent Changes: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/.recent-changes.txt (intent and context)

**CRITICAL MISSION PARAMETERS:**
- DO NOT just make the build pass by removing functionality
- UNDERSTAND what the recent code was trying to achieve
- PRESERVE the intended behavior while fixing errors
- The goal is to make the intended functionality work correctly

**GOAL-ORIENTED FIX APPROACH:**
1. **UNDERSTAND THE INTENT** - Read /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/.recent-changes.txt to understand:
   - What functionality was being added/modified
   - What the developer was trying to achieve
   - The purpose of the recent changes

2. **ANALYZE ERRORS IN CONTEXT**:
   - Read all error files
   - Understand how errors relate to intended functionality
   - Identify if errors are blocking the new feature
   - Determine minimal fixes that preserve intent

3. **FIX WITH PURPOSE**:
   - Make the intended functionality work correctly
   - Don't remove features to make build pass
   - Add missing types/imports to support new code
   - Fix integration issues with existing code
   - Ensure the goal of the changes is achieved

4. **VALIDATE FUNCTIONALITY**:
   - After fixes, ensure build passes
   - Verify the intended feature still works
   - Check that no functionality was lost
   - Confirm the original goal is met

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
- Location: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo
- Build Directory: /Users/amitrebala/Projects/simple-todo/apps/web
- This is likely a Next.js/TypeScript project with Vercel deployment

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Fix ALL errors, not just the first few
- Consider the holistic impact of changes
- Maintain existing functionality
- Follow project conventions
- Do NOT create new files unless absolutely necessary
- Ensure the deployment will succeed on Vercel

**SUCCESS METRICS:**
✓ npm run build completes with zero errors
✓ npm run type-check passes (if available)
✓ All imports resolve correctly
✓ No TypeScript compilation errors
✓ Vercel deployment validation passes
