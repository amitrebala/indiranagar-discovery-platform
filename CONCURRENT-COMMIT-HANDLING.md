# Concurrent Commit Handling

## What Happens When Multiple Terminals Commit Simultaneously?

### Scenario: Two Terminals Run "commit" at the Same Time

```
Terminal 1: Working on Feature A
Terminal 2: Working on Feature B
Both: User says "commit this" at the same time
```

### Protection Mechanisms

#### 1. **Commit Lock File** (`.commit-lock`)
```
Terminal 1 → Acquires lock → Proceeds with commit
Terminal 2 → Sees lock → Waits → Shows message:
             "Another commit is in progress. Waiting..."
             "Lock held by: Terminal: 12345 | PID: 98765 | Time: ..."
```

#### 2. **Git Index Lock** (`.git/index.lock`)
- Prevents Git operations from conflicting
- Automatic 30-second wait if Git is busy
- Clear error messages if stuck

#### 3. **Terminal Isolation**
- Each terminal only commits its own files
- No file conflicts between terminals
- Clean separation of work

    A1[Terminal 1: "commit"] --> B1[Try acquire .commit-lock]
    A2[Terminal 2: "commit"] --> B2[Try acquire .commit-lock]
    
    B1 --> C1[SUCCESS: Got lock]
    B2 --> C2[WAIT: Lock busy]
    
    C1 --> D1[Stage Terminal 1 files]
    C2 --> E2[Wait 2 seconds]
    
    D1 --> F1[Run validation]
    E2 --> B2
    
    F1 --> G1[Commit & Push]
    G1 --> H1[Release lock]
    
    H1 --> I2[Terminal 2 acquires lock]
    I2 --> J2[Stage Terminal 2 files]
    J2 --> K2[Run validation]
    K2 --> L2[Commit & Push]
```

### Timeout Protection

If a terminal gets stuck:
- **5-minute timeout** on commit lock
- Error message with recovery instructions
- Manual unlock: `rm .commit-lock`

### Example Output

**Terminal 1** (goes first):
```
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Terminal ID: 12345
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Preparing terminal-specific commit...
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Staging terminal-specific files...
[SUCCESS] Staged: components/FeatureA.tsx
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Running deployment validation...
[SUCCESS] Deployment validation passed
[SUCCESS] Commit created and pushed!
```

**Terminal 2** (waits, then proceeds):
```
[WARNING] Another commit is in progress. Waiting...
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Lock held by: Terminal: 12345 | PID: 98765 | Time: Mon Nov 11 10:30:45
... (waits for Terminal 1 to finish) ...
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Terminal ID: 67890
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Preparing terminal-specific commit...
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Staging terminal-specific files...
[SUCCESS] Staged: components/FeatureB.tsx
[TERMINAL-COMMIT] Running deployment validation...
[SUCCESS] Deployment validation passed
[SUCCESS] Commit created and pushed!
```

### Benefits

1. **No Conflicts**: Commits are serialized safely
2. **No Mixed Changes**: Each terminal's work stays separate
3. **Clear Feedback**: You know if another commit is running
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Timeouts prevent permanent locks
5. **Clean Git History**: Sequential commits, no merge conflicts

### Edge Cases Handled

- **Terminal crashes**: Lock automatically cleaned up by trap
- **Git conflicts**: Waits for Git index to be available
- **Network issues**: Each commit is independent
- **BMAD fixes**: Each terminal gets its own BMAD session
- **Multiple projects**: Locks are per-repository

### Summary

You CAN run commits from multiple terminals simultaneously:
- The system queues them automatically
- First terminal proceeds immediately
- Other terminals wait their turn
- Each commit is isolated and clean
- No manual intervention needed

The system is designed for real-world multi-terminal development!
