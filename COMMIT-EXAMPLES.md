# Commit Examples - How Claude Code Handles Your Requests

## What You Say → What Claude Does

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Validation Phase**
   - Runs `vercel build` locally
   - Checks for TypeScript errors
   - Validates module imports
   - Ensures build succeeds

2. **Auto-Fix Phase** (if errors found)
   - Fixes TypeScript type errors
   - Resolves missing imports
   - Installs missing dependencies
   - Re-validates after each fix

3. **Commit Phase** (only if validation passes)
   - Stages all changes
   - Creates commit with validation metadata
   - Pushes to GitHub
   - Vercel deployment succeeds!

## If Validation Fails

Claude automatically switches to interactive mode:
```bash
./scripts/claude-deploy-commit.sh "your message"
```

This allows Claude to:
- Analyze complex errors
- Apply intelligent fixes
- Work with you to resolve issues
- Ensure deployment success

## The Result

✅ No more failed Vercel deployments
✅ No more manual log checking
✅ No more copy-paste error cycles
✅ Just say "commit" and it works!
